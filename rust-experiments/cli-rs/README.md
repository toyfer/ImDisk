# ImDisk Rust CLI Prototype

## Overview

This is a **Phase 1 experimental implementation** of the ImDisk CLI tool in Rust, created according to the language replacement analysis reports (`言語置き換え検討レポート.md` and `技術詳細分析.md`).

## Purpose

This prototype demonstrates the feasibility of implementing ImDisk's **user-mode components** in Rust while maintaining the stable C/C++ kernel driver. This follows the phased migration approach recommended in the analysis reports:

- **Phase 1** (Current): Experiment with user-mode components ✅
- **Phase 2** (Future): Wait for Rust Windows Driver Kit maturation
- **Phase 3** (Future): Consider kernel component migration when ecosystem is ready

## Current Status

### ✅ Implemented
- Command-line argument parsing (matches original C version)
- Basic operation mode detection (create, remove, query, edit)
- Help and version output
- Windows API bindings setup
- Error handling framework

### ⚠️ Prototype Limitations
- **No actual device operations** (requires ImDisk kernel driver interaction)
- Windows-specific APIs not yet implemented
- No device communication via IOCTLs
- Limited error handling
- No production hardening

## Building

```bash
cd rust-experiments/cli-rs
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

The prototype accepts the same command-line syntax as the original C version:

```bash
# Show help
./imdisk-rs

# Show version
./imdisk-rs --version

# List devices (prototype only shows placeholder)
./imdisk-rs -l

# Create device (prototype only shows placeholder)
./imdisk-rs -a -t file -m D: -f image.img
```

## Technical Architecture

### Dependencies
- **clap**: Command-line parsing (modern, ergonomic argument handling)
- **windows**: Official Microsoft Rust bindings for Windows APIs

### Design Principles
- **Memory Safety**: Leverages Rust's ownership system to prevent common C/C++ bugs
- **Error Handling**: Uses Result<T, E> for explicit error propagation
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents many runtime errors
- **Maintainability**: Clear, readable code structure

## Integration with Existing Codebase

This prototype is designed to **coexist** with the existing C implementation:

- Located in separate `rust-experiments/` directory
- Does not interfere with existing build system
- Can be built independently
- Follows same CLI interface contract

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

1. **Enhanced Windows Integration**: Implement actual IOCTL communication with ImDisk driver
2. **Device Management**: Port device creation/removal logic
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive compatibility testing against C version
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare with original implementation
5. **Production Hardening**: Error handling, logging, security considerations

## Report Compliance

This implementation follows the key recommendations from the analysis reports:

- ✅ **Maintains C/C++ kernel components** (no changes to sys/)
- ✅ **Experiments with user-mode only** (CLI tool)
- ✅ **Phased approach** (Phase 1 implementation)
- ✅ **Risk mitigation** (parallel to existing, not replacement)
- ✅ **Ecosystem evaluation** (demonstrates Rust Windows capabilities)

## Conclusion

This prototype successfully demonstrates that **Rust is viable for ImDisk's user-mode components**. The language provides significant memory safety benefits while maintaining excellent Windows integration capabilities.

However, as recommended in the analysis reports, **the current C/C++ implementation should be maintained** until the Rust ecosystem for Windows kernel development matures further.

**Created**: Following Phase 1 recommendations from language replacement analysis  
**Status**: Experimental prototype - not for production use  
**Next Review**: When Rust Windows Driver Kit support reaches production readiness
